## Codebase Patterns
- Shadcn components import `cn` from `@/utils` — barrel file at `src/utils/index.ts` re-exports from `./cn`
- Use `ZDOTDIR=/dev/null bash -c 'cd /path && command'` to avoid zoxide shell hook errors
- Shadcn components generated with double quotes and no semicolons — run `npx next lint --fix` to auto-format to project style (single quotes, semicolons, sorted imports)
- `components.json` aliases utils to `@/utils` (not `@/utils/cn`)
- The project uses `md:` breakpoint (768px) for desktop/mobile nav toggle
- `lucide-react` and `class-variance-authority` are not included in the starter — must be installed when adding shadcn components that use them
- Nav links array (`navLinks`) is duplicated in `header.tsx` and `footer.tsx` — consider extracting to shared constant if adding more nav items
- Brand colors are set as HSL CSS variables in `src/styles/globals.css` — use `hsl(var(--primary))` etc. via Tailwind utility classes
- Fonts: Inter (body/`font-sans`) and Playfair Display (headings/`font-heading`) configured via `next/font/google` CSS variables in layout.tsx and Tailwind fontFamily config
- Headings h1-h3 automatically get `font-heading` via globals.css base layer
- Metadata uses `title.template` pattern — child pages can set `title: 'Page Name'` and it becomes `Page Name | Casa Colina Care`
- Section components live in `src/components/sections/`, shared/reusable components in `src/components/shared/`
- Use `SectionHeading` from `@/components/shared/section-heading` for consistent section titles across pages
- Hero height uses `min-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to account for sticky header (h-16 = 4rem)
- Follow [NextJS best practices and standards](../../ai_docs/next.js-project-standards-best-practices.md)
- Follow [TDD protocol](../../ai_docs/test-driven-development-typescript.md)
- Study the agent instructions found in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Study the project structure found in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)

## 2026-02-10 - US-001 Header & Navigation
- Implemented sticky header with desktop navigation and mobile Sheet-based menu
- Installed shadcn Button and Sheet components (plus lucide-react, class-variance-authority)
- Created `src/utils/index.ts` barrel for shadcn cn import compatibility
- Active page link highlighting via `usePathname()`
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` (new)
  - `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx` (new)
  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` (new, shadcn)
  - `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx` (new, shadcn)
  - `src/utils/index.ts` (new)
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` (modified — added Header import and render)
  - `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (updated deps)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Shadcn install generates files with double quotes — always run lint --fix afterward
  - The starter template has no lucide-react or cva installed — these are peer deps for shadcn components
  - `next lint` must be run from the project root (it needs to find app/ directory)
  - `ralph` and `ralph.d` binaries exist as untracked files — exclude from commits

## 2026-02-10 - US-002 Footer
- Implemented footer component with three-column layout (business info, navigation, contact)
- Business name and address displayed in first column
- Navigation links matching header (Home, About Us, FAQ, Contact) in second column
- Phone (click-to-call tel: link) and email (mailto: link) in third column
- Copyright line with dynamic current year
- Added Footer import and render in root layout below {children}
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/layout/footer.tsx` (new)
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` (modified — added Footer import and render)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Footer is a server component (no `'use client'` needed) — it has no interactive state
  - Nav links are duplicated between header and footer — consider extracting to a shared constant in a future refactor
  - The `md:grid-cols-3` pattern works well for responsive footer columns (stacks on mobile)

## 2026-02-10 - US-003 Root Layout
- Replaced Geist fonts with Playfair Display (headings) and Inter (body) via `next/font/google`
- Added Tailwind fontFamily config: `font-sans` (Inter) and `font-heading` (Playfair Display)
- Added base CSS rule applying `font-heading` to h1, h2, h3 elements automatically
- Updated CSS variables with Casa Colina brand colors (Ocean Teal primary, Warm Sand secondary, Sunset Coral accent, Ivory background, Deep Charcoal foreground, Soft Sage muted)
- Removed dark mode CSS block (not needed for this project)
- Added skip-to-content link as first focusable element
- Wrapped children in `<main id="main-content">` for skip-to-content target
- Set default metadata with title template, description, and Open Graph base tags
- Files changed:
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` (modified — replaced fonts, added metadata, skip-to-content, main wrapper)
  - `src/styles/globals.css` (modified — replaced CSS variables with brand colors, added heading font rule)
  - `tailwind.config.ts` (modified — added fontFamily config)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `next/font/google` Playfair_Display uses underscored name for import (not hyphenated)
  - Use `title.template: '%s | Casa Colina Care'` so child pages just set a simple title string
  - The skip-to-content link uses `sr-only` + `focus:not-sr-only` pattern for accessibility
  - Brand HSL values: primary 182 80% 26%, secondary 34 63% 89%, accent 13 68% 63%, background 60 23% 97%, foreground 240 28% 14%

## 2026-02-10 - US-004 Home Page — Hero Section
- Replaced default Next.js starter page content with hero section
- Created `src/components/sections/hero.tsx` — full-viewport hero with gradient background, Playfair Display heading, subtitle, and two CTA buttons
- Created `src/components/shared/section-heading.tsx` — reusable section heading component with optional subtitle and centering
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to render the Hero component
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sections/hero.tsx` (new)
  - `src/components/shared/section-heading.tsx` (new)
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (modified — replaced starter content with Hero)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Section components go in `src/components/sections/`, shared/reusable components in `src/components/shared/`
  - Hero uses `min-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to account for the sticky header height (h-16 = 4rem)
  - The `bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/10 via-background to-secondary/30` gradient creates a subtle brand-colored hero background
  - Button component supports `asChild` prop with `<Link>` for navigation buttons via shadcn's Slot pattern
  - Browser verified: desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) — hero renders correctly at both breakpoints

## 2026-02-12 - US-005 Home Page — Introduction & Services Overview Sections
- Created Introduction section (`src/components/sections/intro.tsx`) with two-column layout: image placeholder left, welcome text right, "Read more about us" link to /about
- Created Services Overview section (`src/components/sections/services-overview.tsx`) with 4 icon cards in responsive grid: Personalized Care Plans (ClipboardList), 24/7 Professional Support (Shield), Home-Cooked Meals (UtensilsCrossed), Beautiful Surroundings (Palmtree)
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to render Hero, Intro, ServicesOverview in order
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sections/intro.tsx` (new)
  - `src/components/sections/services-overview.tsx` (new)
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (modified — added Intro and ServicesOverview imports/renders)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `Palmtree` icon exists in lucide-react v0.563.0 — use it directly (no need for `TreePalm` alternative)
  - `bg-muted/50` creates a subtle alternating section background that visually separates content areas
  - Service cards use dynamic component rendering (`<service.icon />`) from a data array — keeps the markup DRY
  - SectionHeading `centered={false}` works well for two-column layouts where the heading aligns with text content
  - Browser verified at 1440px desktop — all sections render correctly with proper spacing
